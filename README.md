# Roadrunner's "Immersive" lootfilter for PD2 based on Kryszard's filter (Season 10)

## Features
The community favorite [Kryszard's filter](https://github.com/Kryszard-POD/Kryszard-s-PD2-Loot-Filter/tree/main) is really nice but it displays a lot of information that I personally would rather hide in order to have a cleaner UI. So I removed most of the added Notes in item descriptions, condensed the eth/sup/staffmod/etc tags into small handles, removed all rainbow colors and restyled rare item nameplates to have more vanilla look but still feel important and exciting. 

The actual filtering of items is exactly the same as in Kryszard's filter, only the styling and notes have changed. Full credit still goes to him.

I'll be updating this filter with more styling changes as I progress more into endgame. Some of the items there are still untouched, for example Maps and the crafting currency.

## Installation
Download the item.filter file and copy it into C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo II\ProjectD2\filters\local.

Then from the PD2 launcher click the Item Filter Profiles button, select Local Filter, click the item.filter on the right and click Save filter.

Then ingame you can adjust the filter strictness in Options/PD2 Options/Loot Filter/Level. Items are displayed on your level so I recommend starting with strictness level 0 and increase it as you go.

### Gear quality
 - White plus = superior with < 6% ED
 - Light red plus = superior with 6 - 11% ED
 - Red plus = superior with 12 - 15% ED

 <i>Exact ED values are hidden to reduce clutter. Have a little surprise when you pick the item up :)</i>

### Gear staff mods

 - white bar = item has a +1 staffmod
 - yellow bar = item has a +2 staffmod
 - orange bar = item has a +3 staffmod

For example the Guardian Crown has 3 bars - 2 orange and 1 yellow. Meaning it has 3 staffmods, which are +3 +2 +3 respectively.

### Amazon class mods
Similar to the staffmods above except the bars are only white and the number of them shows the level increase: 
 - 2 white bars on a bow = +2 Bow skills. 
 - Similar for Javelins.
